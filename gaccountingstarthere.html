<p>2. Record the transactions for the month of October in a journal (page 1) and post the entries to the ledger. Use balance sheet accounts to record those transactions that will later require adjustments.</p>

<p>f. Interest on the 20% and 24% notes are P20,000 and P8,000, respectively.</p>
<p>4. Complete the worksheet and prepare an income statement, a statement of changes in equity, and a balance sheet.</p>
<p>5. Record the adjusting and closing entries in the journal (page 2) and post the entries to the ledger.</p>
<p>6. Prepare a post-closing trial balance.</p>
